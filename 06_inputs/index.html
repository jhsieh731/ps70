        <h3 class="pixel">Week 6: Electronic Inputs</h3>
        <p>
            This week's assignment was to use a capacitive sensor, another sensor, and at least one 
            output device. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="textcontainer">
        <h4 class="pixel">Part 1: Capacitive sensor</h4>
        <p>
            I wanted to use this week's assignment to begin testing out ideas for my final project. 
            The main input in my final project is to detect whether pieces are on a light switch board.
            A stretch goal of mine was to see if each board place could detect whether or not the correct
            piece was in the spot--this week, I wanted to see if we could use capacitive sensors to detect this.
            (The answer was no, which we will see.)
        </p>

        <div class="flexrow">
            <div class="column">
                <img src="./box.JPG" alt="origami box" width="70%">
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <p>
                    My original idea for the capacitive sensor was to have it measure magnetic fields, as my plans
                    for the inputs on my final project are to have them snap into place on the board using magnets. I spent a
                    long time testing if the capacitive sensor could detect different magnets--my line of thinking was that
                    stronger magnets should result in larger proxy capacitance values, as the distance between the plates
                    should be stronger. It turns out that not only are the parallel capacitance sensors really fickle,
                    but also constantly ripping magnets apart can drastically change readings between trials.
                    Also, I didn't really know how to measure magnetic fields...
                </p>

                <p>
                    While playing around with the "ripping magnets apart" problem, I made a little origami box to control
                    where the base plate and the piece plate would meet, and then
                    tried to see if I could get semi-consistent readings. This didn't really work, so I switched to
                    trying to get these plates to detect weight, which seemed simpler. This calibration ended up being
                    much more successful, though there were still quite a few issues.
                </p>

        <div class="flexrow">
            <div class="column" style="width: 30%">
                <p>
                    On calibration, the relationship actually looked very linear. However, when looking
                    at the sensor values themselves, they looked like they fluctuated a lot. I therefore increased
                    the number of samples taken to 1000, and to make the numbers less extreme, I took average readings. 
                    In any case, these relationships looked really linear.

        <h4 class="pixel">Part 2: Circuitry & Code</h4>
        <p>
            This was the most painless part of the process, though I did rewrite my code halfway through.
            My first idea only had three different inputs and set red/blue/green values as true/false, then turned
            exactly one of the lights on depending on which light piece was detected. Halfway through, I realized
            I needed 4 different light settings, so I instead changed rgb values to be floats from 0 to 1,
            representing the ratio of total "light" that should be from that LED. Supposedly, this should control 
            the actual color that we see (like orange is 50:21:6 for R:G:B). The maximum light value for each
            color is then modulated by this ratio, as well as an intensity value (from the phototransistor).
            Otherwise, I just zombied a lot of code together from lab and class.

            The circuitry was pretty much what was in the lecture notes.

                    I then printed my 3D lamp pieces and tried to see if their intrinsic differences in weight
                    would be good enough for the capacitive sensor to categorize them. This print was mostly a test run,
                    as I scaled them down to be 4cm along each baselength, and I was mostly trying to see if they would
                    turn out ok. Curiously, only the floor lamp turned out pretty poorly: I might try printing the top part
                    as a separate piece and attaching it later (seen in the picture at the top).
                </p>

                <p>
                    It also turned out that the differences in weight for the lamps was not enough for the capacitive sensor to
                    categorize. I thus taped some really big hex nuts to the bases of the lamps, until the final weights were
                    (10g, 27g, 47g, 69g).

        <p>
            The last major issue (beyond huge fluctuations in capacitance generally) is that the "base" capacitance
            when nothing is on the sensor varies wildly between trials/how the sensor is initially set up. I tried
            to offset this by having the arduino take a base reading and then using the linear relationship seen in my
            calibration above to set the cutoffs for each classification, but this is still really fickle and not a great
            workaround. Also, if you touch the sensor in any way that shifts the plates (up/down or left/right), obviously the 
            base value changes. I spent many many hours trying to figure out how to set cutoffs, since the numbers just kept 
            changing between trials. I finally just eyeballed the changes in fluctuations between trials and landed
            on these cutoffs, but they are certainly not backed by hard data collection (which in retrospect may have been a good
            idea). I should find a better way to secure the plates, but I also can't figure out how to secure
            them because it would affect the virtual motion of the plates (affecting distance measured).
        </p>

        <p>
            The last thing I should mention is the phototransistor, which I hooked up like in class. 
            I made it so that in the dark, the LED would be brighter and when it's light out, the LED is 
            basically off. I had to manually change the baseline to be 2800, as the PS70 shop is pretty bright.

        <p>
            Ultimately, unless I can figure out how to stabilize these capacitors, I think that voltage 
            dividers might be a better idea for classifying which lamp is on a certain square. But this was
            still a good exercise, however frustrating it was.
