        <p class="margin"></p>
        These are my ideas for my final project.
        <p class="margin"></p>

        <h4>Idea 1 : Chair for your half-dirty clothes</h4>
        <p class="margin"></p>

        <p>
        This idea is inspired by Simone Giertz' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H175G8NH2Cg">invention</a>.
        The motivation here is that I often have a lot of pants that I'm unwilling to wash after only one use, but also
        not willing to put back with my clean clothes. While Simone's project only uses wood-working to make a nice chair with
        lots of arm space for hanging clothes, I would like to add a few more features.
        </p>

        <p>
In particular, it would be nice if the chair tracked how many wears each pair of pants/clothing had, and could give a
notification
when it was time to wash them. Furthermore, because I am quite lazy, some robotic mechanism to help me put the clothes
on the chair
(i.e. the mini-arms unfold and extend out so you can just lay the pants on and they'll be hung up) would be nice. By
being able to fan out,
it may also be possible to rotate the arms on the chair so that the least worn pair of pants ends up on top (and I will
wear all my pairs of pants roughly an equal amount before washing them all at once). Additionally, the user could ideally manually
set which pair of pants to rotate to the top.
        </p>

        </div>

        <br></br>


        <h4>Idea 2: Modular Light Board</h4>
        <p class="margin"></p>
        
        <p>
            This idea is inspired by a previous PS70 project (the Scratch robot project), because I really liked the modular blocks.
            The idea tackles the fact that I'm really lazy and don't like having to get out of bed to turn off a light when I'm going to bed:
            the best "soft" lighting is often far from the bed. Additionally, I like the idea of being able to change the position of the lights 
            in my room (they are usually lamps) and having a remote control which reflects this flexibility.
        </p>

        <p>
        This project would involve a small grid of squares corresponding to the rough shape of my room. Small blocks with switches corresponding to lights can be placed on the 
        grid, and the lights will turn on/off based on the switch. The blocks can be rearranged to create different patterns, corresponding
        to their placement in the room. This would require some kind of modifier on the power source for the lights, so that the lights
        can be turned on/off based on the switch. As a stretch goal, maybe some (red) blocks could be programmed to turn on automatically at a certain time.
